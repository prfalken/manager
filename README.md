# Manager README

> The following is a user guide for me and how I work as a manager.
> My intent is to accelerate our working relationship with this document.

## My principles
**Managers are here to serve you** While I believe managers are an essential part of a scaling organization, I don’t believe they have a monopoly on leadership, and I work hard to build opportunities in our team for non-managers to lead.

**Check your Ego** Ego blocks and disrupts everything. I have deep respect with people who are able to check their Ego and operate with a high degree of humility. People should be able to admit their flaws, speak freely when they don’t know the answer to some technical problem, ask for help to others, explain how and why they failed.

**Kindness** I don’t want to go 8 hours a day to a job where people are not kind to each other.  I like heated debates especially on technical topics, but I despise any type of violence and I expect people around me to treat their peers with respect, no matter how difficult the conversation can be. Blameless culture should be the default mode. 

**Sense of Ownership**  I feel accountable for the decisions the team make, even if I’m not the one making them most of the time. I will take ownership when things go bad. I expect people to do the same.

**Go out of the comfort zone** This is where we learn. It means I often fail and I look forward to it. My personal and professional life constantly evolves by breaking habits and then struggling to stabilize, by improving skills and resilience. I find interest in life by working on areas where I suck, instead of doing things I’m already good at.

## What I expect from you
**Do an amazing job**. You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t. Give your best skills and motivation to the job, give your best self to your teammates.

**Be a team player** Always try to get consensus, agreement, and input from your teammates.

**Tell me when I screw up.** This is very important. I screw up and sometimes don’t notice. I need to know or I’ll likely do it again.

**Communicate.**  I expect you to communicate as much as possible in your day to day work. One of my jobs is to provide context in and out the team. I will make decisions and move communication up and across the chains based on information you are providing.

## What you can expect from me
**I’m not good at your job**. You know best. I’ll work to provide necessary context and ask questions to help you vet your ideas but I won’t override you. When it comes to the actual work, you are better than me. I’m ok with that and you should be too. But you will see me from time to time making tech decisions when I feel the team is stuck in a conflict.

**Tell the truth** Sometimes I won’t be able to disclose information, but very rarely. Ask me about anything. I will never lie to you.

**Keep feedback safe** It’s very important for me that you can freely talk to me about anything without fear of consequences. I want you to know that I care deeply about trust and that my primary goal is the team members well-being and motivation at work.
You can disagree with me and I will sometimes disagree with you. But I am also very good at switching opinions if you prove me wrong.

**Fight for your interests** I will do my best to advocate for you with the rest of the company. You may not hear about it, but I will always help your opinion be heard in front of others even if I disagreed with you.

**Help you grow your career** I will try to find the best organization, the best projects, the best trainings to help you grow your skills. What matters to me is what you can bring to the team, and what I can bring to you during your career at Blablacar and beyond.

## My personal flaws 
I’m a very enthusiast person and I may be over-enthusiast sometimes. I can be hyperbolic but it’s almost always because I am excited about the topic. I also swear sometimes. Sorry.

Sometimes I think out loud and I can be very approximate. Don’t hesitate to ask for clarification. I might still be brainstorming. Tell me if I’m too vague or even completely wrong.

It’s hard for me to give negative feedback to people. I have a tendency to procrastinate when it comes to having tough conversations and I know it’s not helping at all. 

I have a fear of blanks in conversations and I tend to try to fill them with a lot of words. I see it as fast  and interesting ping-pong of ideas, but for people it sometimes looks like I’m not listening.

## Meetings
Very few things are more important than talking to you if you want to talk to me. If you need to talk, let’s talk. Feel free to put something in my calendar, it’s public and very accurate.

We’ll have a 1:1 every one or two weeks. This meeting discusses topics of substance, not updates on actual work.
Format is up to you : Private meeting room, coffee in a public place, a walk outside. Tell me how you like it best.
Please come prepared with topics we could talk about. I will come with mine.
Of course you don’t need to wait for the 1:1 to bring up topics. I’m available for a coffee anytime when my schedule allows it.
Remember I am here to help you succeed but I can’t do that if I’m not aware of areas I’m failing you in.

## A few unofficial rules
### Off hours
You can Slack me 24 hours a day. I’m a father of 2, so I may not respond right away, but most of the time I do. 
I work a bit on the weekends. This is my choice. I do not expect that you are going to work on the weekend. I might Slack you things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday.

### Show up to meetings 
When you’re invited to a meeting, and unless you have a very good reason, be there on time. You will then have time to argue that your presence is not necessary and you won’t be invited again.
